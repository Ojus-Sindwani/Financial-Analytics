**Project Title: Financial and Accounting Analysis of U.S. Companies During Key Stock Market Crashes**

**Project Overview:**

The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive financial and accounting analysis of a large set of U.S. companies during five significant stock market crashes that occurred over the past few decades. The analysis will focus on understanding the determinants of stock returns during these turbulent periods in financial markets. The five key stock market crashes considered in this study are:

1. 1987 Stock Market Crash (Sept 1987 – Dec 1987)
2. Dot Com Bubble and Crash (Jan 2000 – Oct 2002)
3. Great Recession & Financial Crisis (Jan 2008 – Feb 2009)
4. The Covid Shock (Feb 2020 – March 2020)
5. "The End of Easy Money" (Jan 2022 – Sep 2022)

**Project Tasks:**

- Importing necessary libraries and packages: This includes NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels for data analysis and visualization.

- Uploading the G Sector Files: These files contain information about the Global Industry Classification (GIC) sectors for each year, which will be used for sector-wise analysis.

- Uploading financial ratio files: These files contain various financial ratios derived from previous assignments, including Net Profit Margin, Gross Profit Margin, Liquidity ratio, Leverage, Debt/Total Assets, Asset Turnover Ratio, and ROE.

- Merging financial data with average returns: Merging datasets containing financial data with average returns for the months leading up to each of the five stock market crashes.

- Running logistic regression: Conducting logistic regression analysis for specific financial metrics such as Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Total Liabilities, Long-Term Debt, Cost of Goods Sold, and Retained Earnings.

- Calculating financial ratios and regression analysis: Calculating financial ratios and regressing them against average returns to interpret the results and understand the impact of financial metrics on stock returns during market crashes.

- Treating missing values and merging datasets: Handling missing values in the datasets and merging dataframes based on the 'TICKER' column to create comprehensive datasets for analysis.

**Project Deliverables:**

The project will deliver insights into the financial health and performance of U.S. companies during significant stock market crashes. This information will help investors and decision-makers understand the factors influencing stock returns during economic downturns and make informed investment decisions.
