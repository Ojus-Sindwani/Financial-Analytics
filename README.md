# Financial-Analytics
This project aims to leverage advanced quantitative modeling techniques to analyze vast amounts of financial data and extract valuable insights that can inform trader decisions and enhance performance in the dynamic and complex world of financial markets.

The aim of the project is to conduct a financial and accounting analysis of a large set of U.S. companies during five key stock market crashes over the past few decades. These crashes include:

1987 Stock Market Crash (Sept 1987 – Dec 1987)
Dot Com Bubble and Crash (Jan 2000 – Oct 2002)
Great Recession & Financial Crisis (Jan 2008 – Feb 2009)
The Covid Shock (Feb 2020 – March 2020)
"The End of Easy Money" (Jan 2022 – Sep 2022)
The project aims to explain the determinants of stock returns during these market crashes. Key tasks include:

Importing necessary libraries and packages such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels.
Uploading the G Sector Files, which contain information about the Global Industry Classification (GIC) sectors for each year.
Uploading files containing financial ratios derived from Assignment 3, including ratios for Net Profit Margin, Gross Profit Margin, Liquidity ratio, Leverage, Debt/Total Assets, Asset Turnover Ratio, and ROE.
Merging financial data with average returns for the months leading up to the five stock market crashes.
Running logistic regression for specific financial metrics such as Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Total Liabilities, Long-Term Debt, Cost of Goods Sold, and Retained Earnings.
Calculating financial ratios and regressing them against average returns to interpret the results.
Treating missing values and merging dataframes based on the 'TICKER' column.
Providing a detailed analysis of the financial and accounting factors influencing stock returns during the identified market crashes.
The project involves merging and analyzing various datasets to identify trends, correlations, and determinants of stock returns during significant market downturns. By conducting regression analysis and calculating financial ratios, the project aims to provide insights into the financial health and performance of companies during times of economic uncertainty. This information can help investors and decision-makers understand the factors driving stock market crashes and make informed investment decisions.
